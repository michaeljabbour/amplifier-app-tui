"""Every op serve services is classified -- so no mutation can go unattributed.

AC4 says every automated action must be attributable. Before this, that was
true of the control plane and the five transcript writes, and quietly false
everywhere else: ``tag.add`` / ``tag.remove`` / ``effort.set`` / ``effort.cycle``
changed the session with no lease check and no audit entry at all. A controller
could rename, retag and re-tier a session it did not hold the pen for, and the
trail would show nothing.

Fixing the four that existed is not the interesting part -- the interesting
part is making the sixth one, added next year by someone who has never read
this file, impossible to get wrong. So classification is not a convention: it
is :data:`~amplifier_app_tui.kernel.serve.OP_PERMISSIONS`, a table the dispatch
loop reads. An op in it as ``write`` is routed through
``SessionControl.authorize``, which cannot accept it without appending
``write.accepted``; an op missing from it fails the first test below.

That is the whole mechanism: the audit trail is not something an implementer
must remember to call, it is something the routing does on their behalf, and
this file is the tripwire on the routing.
