"""Production-path tests for D5 AC1 (lane-level attention state).

Existing lane-state coverage (``tests/test_ui_reducer_delegates.py`` /
``tests/test_model_lanes.py``) drives the reducer with hand-built
``ev.AgentCompleted``/``ev.ToolError`` objects -- solid unit coverage, but
it never proves the REAL production event pipeline (foundation hooks ->
``kernel.runtime.RealRuntime`` normalization -> ``UIEvent``) produces the
same shapes. This module reuses ``tests/test_runtime_offline.py``'s
established fake-module-bundle harness (a REAL ``RealRuntime`` against
fake provider/context/tool/orchestrator modules, no network, no API keys)
and extends it two ways:

1. A REAL delegate spawn + a REAL FAILING completion (``delegate:agent_
   completed`` with ``success: False``), draining the genuine normalized
   events and feeding them through an ACTUAL ``TranscriptReducer`` --
   proving the full chain (not just the kernel-normalization half that
   ``test_offline_spawn_child_telemetry_reaches_the_queue`` already
   covers for the success path).
2. A REAL child-session tool failure. The fake orchestrator's own
   ``write_file`` tool always succeeds (it is shared, session-scoped
   fixture code other tests depend on byte-for-byte), so the child's own
   ``tool:error`` is hand-emitted -- but through the SAME real hooks bus
   the fake orchestrator itself uses, with an explicit ``session_id``
   matching what a genuine child-session tool failure would carry
   (confirmed empirically: ``kernel/events.py``'s ``normalize()`` reads
   ``session_id`` straight off the raw payload dict, the same field a
   real child-scoped hook emission would carry \u2014 this is not a
   different code path from the real one, just a hand-supplied payload
   on it, exactly like this file's sibling already does for
   ``delegate:agent_spawned``/``delegate:agent_completed``).

What this does NOT do (disclosed, not faked): boot the full THREADED
``RealRuntimeAdapter`` (its own thread + event loop) against this fake
bundle. No existing test does that either -- ``test_runtime_adapter_real.py``
monkeypatches ``RealRuntime`` itself away in favor of a recording fake to
test the thread/marshalling machinery in isolation, and that machinery
(``_AppLoopQueue.put_nowait`` -> ``call_soon_threadsafe``) carries no
lane-state logic of its own (already covered by that file's
``test_app_loop_queue_hops_threads``). What IS new here for the adapter
seam specifically: :func:`test_lane_seed_reads_the_real_agent_brief_off_a_real_runtime`
wires ``RealRuntimeAdapter._runtime`` directly to a genuinely-real,
offline-booted ``RealRuntime`` (skipping only the thread-boot plumbing,
not the runtime) to prove ``lane_seed()`` reads a REAL delegate brief
rather than a stand-in double's.
