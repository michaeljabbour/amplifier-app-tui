"""Durable, collapsible thinking block in the transcript (issue #129).

The model's reasoning lands as a default-collapsed Thinking block inline in
the transcript. ctrl-g (or enter on the focused block) expands/collapses it
in place; a withheld (empty-text) block is not expandable. When no durable
block exists, ctrl-g falls back to PR #128's live-tail reveal.
