# Implementation plans

Dated, execution-ready plans and design/decision docs. Each carries a **Status**
banner at the top; once a plan lands (or a decision is recorded) it stays here as the
historical record of what was decided and why — deviations are noted in the banner. The
live list of open work is [../BACKLOG.md](../BACKLOG.md).

## Decision / design docs (2026-07-22 audit round)

Doc-only deliverables from the backlog campaign — the design or decision *is* the
artifact; any follow-on implementation is tracked in the linked issue.

| Doc | Status |

## Architecture tracks (compliance round, 2026-08-02)

Design-only tracks: the specification *is* the deliverable, and it is **design direction, not
a confirmed implementation commitment**. Each names its required-but-missing contract
extensions explicitly rather than assuming them.

| Doc | Status |
|---|---|
| [voice-first, ambient delegation](2026-08-03-voice-first-ambient-delegation.md) | 📐 Design direction proposed (compliance item B8; built on the B6 session-control contract in [../SESSION-CONTROL.md](../SESSION-CONTROL.md) and the B7 attention contract) |
