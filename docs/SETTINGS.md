# Settings Reference

Every configuration surface the app reads, in one place. Startup settings loading lives in
`kernel/config.py` (`resolve_config()` — the single configuration golden path); live
session directory capabilities are administered in `kernel/directory_permissions.py`.

## Files and merge order

Three startup YAML scopes are merged in order (most specific wins; dicts merge recursively):

| Order | File | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `~/.amplifier/settings.yaml` | global — you, on this machine |
| 2 | `<project>/.amplifier/settings.yaml` | project — shared, committed |
| 3 | `<project>/.amplifier/settings.local.yaml` | local — per-machine, gitignored |

A resumed session additionally reads
`~/.amplifier/projects/<slug>/sessions/<id>/settings.yaml`. `/allowed-dirs` and
`/denied-dirs` write that session scope and update mounted filesystem tools immediately.
The permission fields `allowed_write_paths`, `allowed_read_paths`, and
`denied_write_paths` are stable-unioned across scopes; other lists retain overlay-wins
semantics.

Missing or malformed files are skipped with a warning — settings can never block startup.
(`/doctor` surfaces parse failures.)

### Shared platform settings vs TUI preferences

The files stay under the shared `~/.amplifier` home. Provider configuration, routing,
bundle registries/overlays, module/source overrides, keys, and the Foundation cache are
platform data used by both `amplifier` and `amplifier-tui`; they remain top-level.
Preferences that govern only the full-screen app use the `tui:` namespace:

```yaml
tui:
  bundle:
    active: tui
    deferred: [large-overlay]
  hooks:
    suppress: [hook-context-intelligence]
  permissions:
    governance: open
  preflight:
    verify_live: false
  pricing:
    live: true
  resume:
    use_active_bundle: false

# Shared platform settings stay top-level.
routing:
  matrix: balanced
config:
  providers: []
```

For migration, the former top-level app paths (`bundle.active`, `bundle.deferred`,
`hooks.suppress`, `permissions.*`, `preflight.*`, `pricing.live`, and
`resume.use_active_bundle`) are still read as fallbacks. Within one scope, a `tui:` value
wins; normal scope order still wins across files, so a project legacy value remains more
specific than a global namespaced value. `bundle use` now writes only
`tui.bundle.active` and preserves any legacy/platform data. `bundle clear` masks an old
top-level active value without deleting it, preventing another app's setting from being
clobbered or unexpectedly resurfacing in TUI.

**Credentials — `~/.amplifier/keys.env`**: simple `KEY=value` lines (`#` comments allowed,
surrounding quotes stripped), loaded into the environment at startup. **Exported
environment variables always win** — a var already in your shell is never overwritten.
This is the same file `amplifier init` writes, so credentials are shared with the
Amplifier CLI.

**`${VAR}` / `${VAR:default}` placeholders** in any configuration string expand from the
environment: unset with a default → the default; unset without one → empty. Fail-safe: a
config value that is *exactly* one unset `${VAR}` with no default is dropped entirely
rather than expanded to `""` (this prevents e.g. a provider being handed an empty
`base_url`).

## Reading and writing from the CLI

Bare `amplifier-tui settings` opens a full-screen **settings panel** over the same
files — the interactive surface; the `get|set|unset` trio below is the scriptable one.
The panel's sidebar carries the six sections plus a read-only **Maintenance** tab;
`amplifier-tui settings <section>` deep-links into one and bare `amplifier-tui init`
opens it on Providers. Edits stage without writing (`*` marks them) until `ctrl+s`
shows a redacted review and you confirm; secrets write to `keys.env` masked and are
never echoed. `s` cycles the write scope, `u` stages an unset, `/` filters the visible
section, and Escape exits. It needs a real terminal — redirected stdin/stdout exits 2
(`amplifier-tui config` remains as a hidden alias opening the same panel).

The `settings get|set|unset` trio is the scriptable per-key surface over the files above
— no YAML editing by hand:

```
amplifier-tui settings get                     # list the six settings sections
amplifier-tui settings get <section>           # one section's settings, redacted
amplifier-tui settings get <path>              # one value plus its source
amplifier-tui settings set <path> <value> [--global|--project|--local]
amplifier-tui settings unset <path> [--global|--project|--local]
```

The scope flags pick the write target (`--global` is the default, matching the merge
table above; pass exactly one). Reads resolve most-specific-scope-first, the mirror of
the merge order, and `get` annotates each value with where it came from:
`env` / `keys.env` / `local` / `project` / `global` / `default` (plus the file path for
scope sources). Resolution runs through the same code the runtime uses, so what `get`
prints is what a session sees — including legacy top-level fallbacks for namespaced
`tui:` keys.

**Secrets never touch a settings file.** Keys.env-backed fields (the provider API keys
and tokens, `notifications.push.topic`) are read from and written to
`~/.amplifier/keys.env` no matter which scope flag is passed — the flag is ignored for
them — and their values are never echoed: `get` prints `configured` or `not set`, and a
successful `set` declines to repeat the value. An exported environment variable beats a
stored `keys.env` line, same as at runtime.

Values are validated before they land: booleans accept `true/false` (also `yes/no`,
`on/off`, `1/0`), lists are comma-separated, and choice and numeric fields check their
options and bounds — failures print a plain-language message and exit 2 (a usage error,
like an unknown path); a write that fails on disk prints the reason and exits 1.
`unset` is idempotent — removing an absent value reports "nothing to do" with exit 0 —
so scripts can assert end state. Field paths are the dotted display paths `settings get`
prints (e.g. `tui.permissions.governance`); app-owned keys land in their namespaced
`tui:` location in the scope file, and the `notifications.*` paths map to
`config.notifications.*`. Every setting currently **applies at the next session** — a
running TUI is unaffected until restart. `config show --json` remains the whole-surface
snapshot; the trio is for one key at a time.

## Settings keys

This is the complete set of keys the app consumes:

| Key | Effect | Default | Typical scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tui.bundle.active` | Which bundle to load when `--bundle` isn't passed (written by `bundle use`; legacy fallback: `bundle.active`) | `tui` (packaged) | global or project |
| `tui.bundle.deferred` | Names/URIs from shared `bundle.app` to hold out of startup and load on demand (legacy fallback: `bundle.deferred`) | none | global or project |
| `bundle.app` | List of overlay bundle URIs composed onto **every** session (behavior add-ons) | none | global |
| `bundle.added` | Registry of `name → URI` for discoverable bundles (written by `bundle add`) | none | global |
| `routing.matrix` | Active model-routing matrix name for delegated sub-agents. Naming a matrix opts in: the app auto-composes the `routing-matrix` overlay (which mounts `hooks-routing`) and feeds this value as its `default_matrix`. Not mounted in the base bundle (anchors parity) | none (off) | global |
| `routing.enabled` | Explicit routing on/off switch (wins over `routing.matrix`). `true` mounts `hooks-routing` even with no matrix named (uses the bundle default, `balanced`); `false` keeps it off even when a matrix is named | derived from `routing.matrix` | global or project |
| `tui.hooks.suppress` | Extra hook module IDs stripped from the mount plan at boot, unioned with the built-in suppression list (`hooks-streaming-ui`, `hooks-todo-display`, `hooks-notify`, and legacy `hooks-notify-push`). A boot notice lists everything suppressed. `hooks-logging` remains mounted because it owns canonical `events.jsonl`; `hooks-insight-blocks`/`hooks-inline-blocks` inject instructions (no stdout), so their blockquote callouts render natively with a `▌` gutter. Legacy fallback: `hooks.suppress` | none (built-ins always apply) | global or project |
| `routing.overrides` | Per-role candidate overrides merged onto the matrix | none | project |
| `config.providers` | Provider entries merged by identity (`id` \| `instance_id` \| `module`): reconfigure the bundled provider or append new ones (see the README's Providers section) | none | global (credentials via `${VAR}`) |
| `context.max_tokens` | Fallback request budget for `context-simple` when the serving provider exposes no model limit. Provider-derived budgets take precedence; `/context` adopts that effective budget after the first native compaction event | `300000` (inherited from the composed anchors bundle) | global or project |
| `tui.preflight.verify_provider` | Whether the pre-takeover preflight (S4/AC4) really mounts the priority provider and checks its credentials, in addition to resolving the mount plan. `false` is an escape hatch back to plan-only checking. Legacy fallback: `preflight.verify_provider` | `true` | global or project |
| `tui.preflight.verify_live` | Also confirms the selected model exists via a live, network-bound `list_models()` call (and, as a side effect, that the credential is accepted). Normal launches skip this by default; `--dry-run` always enables it for that one invocation regardless of this setting. Legacy fallback: `preflight.verify_live` | `false` | global or project |
| `context.compact_threshold` | `context-simple` window fraction that triggers automatic compaction (`0 < value <= 1`) | `0.8` (inherited from the composed anchors bundle) | global or project |
| `context.auto_compact` | Enable `context-simple` automatic compaction; the runtime binding also disables legacy threshold-only context modules truthfully | `true` (inherited from the composed anchors bundle) | global or project |
| `modules.tools` | Tool entries merged by identity; filesystem permission lists union across scopes | project root is implicitly writable | global / project / local / session |
| `tui.permissions.write_boundary` | App-level write gate. `open` (default, amplifier-app-cli parity): no governance pre-flight for writes outside the project and no write-shaped shell gating — the mounted filesystem tool stays the sole write enforcement (graceful tool error, never an approval). `guarded`: outside writes are blocked pre-flight and write-shaped shell escapes are classified outside-project. Denied and protected paths are enforced in both. **Audit H2 safeguard:** `open` is only kept when a `tool-filesystem` is actually mounted to enforce it — if no filesystem write-enforcer is in the mount plan, the boundary auto-degrades to `guarded` at startup with a boot notice. Legacy fallback: `permissions.write_boundary` | `open` (backed by a filesystem tool; else `guarded`) | global or project |
| `tui.permissions.governance` | App governance in the **default (`auto`) posture**. `open` (default, platform parity): `auto` is a pure pass-through; `gated` restores the classifier gate in `auto`. Explicitly chosen postures (`plan`, `brainstorm`, `chat`, `build`) always enforce. Legacy fallback: `permissions.governance` | `open` | global or project |
| `tui.pricing.live` | Live Helicone pricing: fresh `~/.amplifier/pricing_cache.json` (24 h TTL) applies at startup, else a background fetch swaps rates in for **new turns only**; `false` keeps the built-in offline table. Legacy fallback: `pricing.live` | `true` | global |
| `tui.resume.use_active_bundle` | `resume` normally reattaches a session under the **bundle it was stored with** (its module stack is part of its identity); `true` attaches under the currently active bundle instead. An explicit `--bundle` on the resume command always wins. Legacy fallback: `resume.use_active_bundle` | `false` (honor stored) | global or project |
| `sources.modules` | Map of `module_id → source URI`: redirect where a module is fetched from | none | local (dev checkouts) |
| `overrides.<id>.source` | Per-module source redirect; wins over `sources.modules` | none | local |
| `overrides.<id>.config` | Dict deep-merged into that module's config (applied before `config.providers` / `modules.tools`, so those win) | none | project / local |
| `telemetry.*` | Configures the composed **context-intelligence-logging** behavior (module `hook-context-intelligence`): `telemetry.destinations` is the multi-destination fan-out map, `telemetry.server_url`/`api_key`/`workspace` the legacy single destination, plus dispatch tuning. A no-op unless that behavior is composed via `bundle.app`; see *Context-intelligence telemetry* below | none (local JSONL capture only) | global or project |
| `config.notifications.*` | Attention-notification config: `suppress` silences delivery while preserving durable state; `desktop.enabled` gates the OSC 777 rung (`false`→off, `true`→force any terminal); `push`/`ntfy` (`enabled`/`server`/`priority`/`tags`) configure the app-owned ntfy destination. The ntfy **topic** is a secret — it lives in `keys.env` (`AMPLIFIER_NTFY_TOPIC`), never a settings scope. Explicit env vars win over ordinary settings fields; written by the `notify` CLI. See *Attention notifications* below | none (env + native ladder) | global or project |

**Bundle discovery**, for `--bundle NAME` or `tui.bundle.active`: `<project>/.amplifier/bundles/`
→ `~/.amplifier/bundles/` → the packaged `data/bundles/` — first hit wins. Names resolve as
`<name>.md`, `<name>.yaml`, or `<name>/bundle.md|bundle.yaml`. Drop a bundle file into one
of these directories and it's addressable by name. `bundle list` additionally enumerates the
shared foundation `BundleRegistry` (well-known + fetched bundles).

**MCP servers — `~/.amplifier/mcp.json`** (and `<project>/.amplifier/mcp.json`): top-level
`mcpServers` map (`name → {command, args, env}` for stdio, or `{url, type, headers}` for
http). The mounted `tool-mcp` reads these at session start and exposes each server's tools
as `mcp_<server>_<tool>`. `/mcp add|remove` edits this file (takes effect next launch).

**Native modes** are discovered from `<project>/.amplifier/modes/` → `~/.amplifier/modes/`
→ the app's packaged `data/modes/` (plan/brainstorm/careful) → composed bundles' `modes/`.
`hooks-mode` + `hooks-approval` + `tool-mode` arrive via the composed anchors bundle (same
modules, same configs). Those native hooks are idle without an active native mode, and by
default (`tui.permissions.governance: open`) the app's own governance hook is a pass-through in
the `auto` posture too — so a fresh session has **zero** approval gates, matching the
platform. The app hook still enforces explicitly chosen postures (plan/brainstorm/chat/build),
runs its output-injection probe, and shares the native hooks' approval provider;
`tui.permissions.governance: gated` restores its classifier gate in `auto`.

**Context-intelligence telemetry (`context-intelligence-logging`).** The app can fan session
events out to one or more telemetry destinations by composing the upstream
`context-intelligence-logging` behavior — the app mounts that behavior's `hook-context-intelligence`
sink and never reimplements one. Enable it with a `bundle.app` overlay, then configure destinations
under the `telemetry` settings section:

```yaml
bundle:
  app:
    # telemetry-only layer; upstream main verified and pinned 2026-08-05
    - git+https://github.com/michaeljabbour/amplifier-bundle-context-intelligence@dea8a4b3bb2424fb0306d15dfb8f029098ba64dd#subdirectory=behaviors/context-intelligence-logging.yaml

telemetry:
  destinations:                      # multi-destination fan-out (upstream `destinations` map)
    team:
      url: https://ci.example.com
      api_key: ${CI_TEAM_KEY}        # secrets referenced from keys.env as ${VAR}
      include: ["*"]                 # .gitignore-style session routing (this dest gets everything)
      auth_mode: static              # static | entra
    scratch:
      url: http://localhost:8000
      exclude: ["*"]                 # routed away from this destination
  # dispatch tuning (all optional):
  dispatch_timeout: 30
  dispatch_failure_threshold: 3      # boot/turn unaffected when a server is unreachable
  # legacy single-destination form (older module builds), instead of `destinations`:
  # server_url: ${AMPLIFIER_CONTEXT_INTELLIGENCE_SERVER_URL}
  # api_key: ${AMPLIFIER_CONTEXT_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY}
  # workspace: my-workspace
```

Semantics:

- **No destinations configured → local capture only.** With the behavior composed but no
  `telemetry.destinations` (or legacy `server_url`), the hook writes only its local per-session
  JSONL under `~/.amplifier/projects/<slug>/sessions/<id>/context-intelligence/` — no network.
- **Unreachable server never blocks the boot or a turn.** Dispatch is best-effort behind a circuit
  breaker (`dispatch_failure_threshold` consecutive failures opens it); the session runs regardless.
- **`delegate:*` events flow to it.** The behavior ships `additional_events` covering the delegate
  lifecycle (`agent_spawned`/`resumed`/`completed`/`cancelled`/`error`); `telemetry.additional_events`
  is *unioned* onto that list, never replacing it. The app's boot suppression list never strips
  `hook-context-intelligence` (add it to `tui.hooks.suppress` yourself to opt out).
- **In-flight dispatches are drained on exit.** The hook's async `cleanup()` is awaited through the
  app's normal session teardown (`session.cleanup()`), bounded by `telemetry.close_drain_timeout`.
- **Relationship to the other logs.** This is a *third* writer, independent of the two per-session
  logs described in ARCHITECTURE §9: `hooks-logging` owns `events.jsonl` (canonical hook records)
  and the app owns `ui-events.jsonl` (normalized UIEvents). The context-intelligence hook keeps its
  own JSONL and fans out to servers; it shares no file or schema with either.

**Compaction accounting.** The runtime binds these settings directly to the mounted
context module. When that module accepts provider-observed input tokens, TUI forwards
exact `provider:response` usage and `/status` reports `provider-observed accounting`;
otherwise it reports `estimated accounting`. Native `context:compaction` events are
normalized into the same event stream as every other runtime event.

**Protected project paths.** The filesystem and recognized shell-target policy always
deny writes beneath `.git/`, `.agents/`, `.codex/`, and `AGENTS.md`. These are defaults,
not settings entries, so a broader allowed directory or approval cannot override them.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| any `${VAR}` referenced in config | expanded into provider/tool/hook config (rules above) |
| anything in `~/.amplifier/keys.env` | injected at startup; your exported env wins |
| `TEXTUAL_DISABLE_KITTY_KEY` | force the shift+enter advertisement off (fallback hints) |
| `TERM`, `TMUX`, `TERM_PROGRAM`, `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION`, `XTERM_VERSION`, `KITTY_WINDOW_ID`, `WEZTERM_PANE`, `GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR`, `WT_SESSION` | terminal capability probe — affects only which key *hints* are advertised (bindings are unchanged) |
| `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `DISPLAY` | clipboard backend selection on Linux (wl-copy vs xclip) |
| `AMPLIFIER_NOTIFY` | App-owned local attention-ladder selector. `false`/`0`/`no`/`off` silences bell + desktop delivery; `bell` caps at the audible terminal bell; unset / `true` / `1` / `on` / `desktop` opens both local rungs (including an OSC 777 desktop notification when the window is unfocused). Use `config.notifications.suppress: true` or `AMPLIFIER_NOTIFY_PUSH_ENABLED=false` to silence push too |
| `AMPLIFIER_TERMINAL_NOTIFICATIONS` | Desktop (OSC 777) rung gate. `off`/`0`/`false`/`never`/`none` silences the desktop notification anywhere; `force`/`on`/`1`/`true`/`always` enables it on any terminal (bypasses the render allowlist). Unset uses the built-in allowlist below |
| `AMPLIFIER_NTFY_TOPIC` | Secret ntfy topic for app-owned off-machine attention delivery; unset keeps push inert |
| `AMPLIFIER_NTFY_SERVER` | ntfy server URL; overrides `config.notifications.push.server` |
| `AMPLIFIER_NOTIFY_PUSH_ENABLED` | Explicit push enable/disable; overrides `config.notifications.push.enabled` |

The app reads the five attention-notification variables above. Other `AMPLIFIER_*`
variables may belong to mounted bundle modules — for example, `tool-team-pulse` reads
`AMPLIFIER_TEAM_PULSE_URL` / `AMPLIFIER_TEAM_PULSE_KEY`. When the `context-intelligence-logging`
behavior is composed, its `hook-context-intelligence` also reads the
`AMPLIFIER_CONTEXT_INTELLIGENCE_SERVER_URL` / `_API_KEY` / `_WORKSPACE` env vars as a fallback
for the `telemetry` settings above.

## Attention notifications

When the assistant needs you — a turn finishes after a long run, or a decision is deferred
to the needs-you queue — the app climbs a two-rung local ladder instead of writing raw escapes
to the TTY (which would corrupt the full-screen Textual screen the way the suppressed
`hooks-notify` did):

1. **Bell** — Textual's driver-safe `App.bell`. Always the first rung; works on every
   terminal. Rings when a decision is deferred (always) or a turn finishes after ~10s.
2. **Desktop (OSC 777)** — an out-of-band `\x1b]777;notify;<title>;<body>` escape the
   terminal renders as a native OS notification, written through the same sanctioned
   driver path as the terminal title (never raw stdout). The ladder climbs here **only
   when the terminal window is unfocused** (you looked away), the terminal is on the
   render allowlist, and `AMPLIFIER_NOTIFY` was not capped at `bell`.
Separately, the app-owned kernel destination can send **off-machine ntfy push**
(`AMPLIFIER_NTFY_TOPIC`) when you are away from the machine entirely. It consumes only the
normalized `attention:recorded` event, so push shares the same transition and
restart/reconnect-dedupe contract as the two local rungs.

`AMPLIFIER_NOTIFY` gates the app-owned bell/desktop ladder (see the table above);
`AMPLIFIER_NOTIFY=false` is the historical local kill switch. Use persisted
`config.notifications.suppress: true` to disable those rungs **and** the app-owned push
destination. The desktop rung's terminal
**allowlist** — terminals known to render OSC notifications rather than print them as
garbage — is kitty (via `TERM`/`KITTY_WINDOW_ID`) and ghostty / iTerm2 / WezTerm / Warp
(via `TERM_PROGRAM`). `AMPLIFIER_TERMINAL_NOTIFICATIONS=force` opts any other terminal in;
`=off` opts any terminal out.

**One normalized event per transition.** The bell and desktop rungs above are both driven
by a single internal `AttentionRecord` (session id, reason, a stable event id, and an
acknowledged flag) minted exactly once when the app transitions into needing you — a turn
completes, a decision is parked awaiting your approval or clarification, or the session
hits a session-level error. The `error` reason is wired to three real production
transitions: a turn that raised out of `submit()` (provider auth expiry, a network drop
mid-turn), a `provider:error` notice (retry/throttle notices do not qualify — only
`error`), and a delegate that settles into the lane registry's terminal `error` state
(never `cancelled`, which is a deliberate interrupt, not a failure). Repeated renders, a
reconnect, or a second kernel-side ping for a decision that is already parked all resolve
to the SAME record and do not notify again. Answering a deferred decision, or bringing the
terminal window back into focus, acknowledges the record: the bell has nothing to retract,
but the OSC 777 desktop indicator is best-effort cleared. Muting every delivery destination
does not erase this internal state: the record is still minted and persisted, while the
delivery rung list is empty.

**Durable across restarts and second processes.** The record above is no longer purely
in-memory: once a real session's directory is known (after boot), `AttentionCenter` binds
to a durable `attention.json` kept beside that session's `control.json` (the SAME
atomic-write-under-a-lock idiom `kernel/session_control.py` uses for its own state — not a
second mechanism). A restart, or a second process pointed at the same session directory
(e.g. a `serve` controller), observes whatever was last persisted and its dedupe/ack state.
Every persist/load is best-effort and non-blocking: a failure is logged and swallowed,
never raised, so a durability problem can never affect the live session.

**Off-machine push is record-driven too.** `RealRuntime` emits each newly minted record once
as `attention:recorded`; it does not project a second completion event and the bundle no
longer mounts the upstream raw-completion notifier. `kernel/attention_push.py` consumes that
canonical event through a bounded FIFO, derives ntfy's URL/header-safe 64-character sequence
ID deterministically from the record's stable `event_id`, and publishes with
`X-Sequence-ID`. Re-delivery of the same record therefore targets the same destination
sequence instead of minting a second identity.

When the record is acknowledged, the runtime emits `attention:acknowledged` with the original
event ID and no user content. The same deterministic mapping issues
`PUT /<topic>/<sequence-id>/clear`, ntfy's documented mark-read-and-dismiss operation. Slow,
failed, or saturated push delivery is contained and cannot block the hooks bus or the live
session; acknowledgement clears are prioritized over queued publishes under saturation.
Remote servers require HTTPS, with plaintext HTTP accepted only for an explicit
localhost/loopback development endpoint. The secret topic and notification body are never
included in app logs.

### Configuring notifications (`config.notifications.*` + the `notify` CLI)

The ladder above reads two env vars directly; the `config.notifications` settings section
lets you persist the same choices (and the ntfy push knobs) per scope. The
kernel config/runtime lower them onto the same seams the destinations already use, and
**an explicit env var wins over ordinary settings fields** (settings only fill an unset
var). `suppress: true` disables the app-owned push destination as well as local delivery so a
purported global kill switch cannot leave an off-machine destination active. An unconfigured
app stays inert.

Honored keys:

| Key | Effect | Maps to |
|---|---|---|
| `config.notifications.suppress` | `true` silences bell, desktop, and app-owned push; durable attention state remains available | `AMPLIFIER_NOTIFY=off` (when unset) + destination disabled |
| `config.notifications.desktop.enabled` | `false` drops the desktop rung (bell still rings); `true` forces desktop on **any** terminal (bypasses the render allowlist) | `AMPLIFIER_TERMINAL_NOTIFICATIONS=off`/`force` (when unset) |
| `config.notifications.push.enabled` (alias `ntfy.enabled`) | Enable/disable off-machine ntfy push | app destination (env `AMPLIFIER_NOTIFY_PUSH_ENABLED` wins) |
| `config.notifications.push.server` (alias `ntfy.server`) | ntfy server URL | app destination (env `AMPLIFIER_NTFY_SERVER` wins) |
| `config.notifications.push.priority` | ntfy message priority (`min`\|`low`\|`default`\|`high`\|`urgent`) | app destination priority |
| `config.notifications.push.tags` | ntfy emoji tags (list or comma string) | app destination tags |

The `push`/`ntfy` blocks are aliases (ntfy is the only transport); on a field-level conflict
the `ntfy` block wins, matching amplifier-app-cli.

**The ntfy topic is a secret**, not a settings key. Public ntfy topics are world-readable, so
the app destination reads the topic **only** from `AMPLIFIER_NTFY_TOPIC` (stored in
`~/.amplifier/keys.env`). `notify set topic <topic>` writes it there; it is never persisted to,
or displayed from, a settings scope.

The `notify` command group is the admin surface (same scope-file writers as `source`/`routing`;
`--global` default, `--project`, `--local`):

```
amplifier-tui notify show                 # effective config (settings + env resolved)
amplifier-tui notify set <key> <value>    # persist a key (unknown key -> error, exit 1)
amplifier-tui notify enable|disable [desktop|push]   # toggle a channel (default: desktop)
amplifier-tui notify set topic <topic>    # secret -> keys.env
amplifier-tui notify test                 # test the app-owned bell + desktop ladder
```

**Documented-unsupported.** amplifier-app-cli's desktop notifications go through its
OS-integration `hooks-notify` (terminal-notifier), which tui suppresses at boot because it
writes raw OSC/BEL to stdout and corrupts the full-screen TUI. tui's desktop rung is the
driver-safe OSC 777 path instead, which carries only a title + a bounded (240-char) body. So the
app-cli desktop sub-keys that have no OSC 777 channel are **accepted in a shared settings file but
not honored** by tui: `desktop.sound` (OSC 777 has no sound channel), `desktop.show_device` /
`desktop.show_project` / `desktop.subtitle` / `desktop.show_preview` / `desktop.preview_length` /
`desktop.min_iterations` / `desktop.show_iteration_count`. `notify set` only accepts the keys
tui actually honors, so it never lets you set a field that would silently do nothing.

## Quirks worth knowing

- **Theme is not persisted.** `/theme` switches at runtime only; every launch starts on
  `slate`. There is currently no settings key for it.
- **Approval timeout floor is fixed.** The app raises the kernel's 300 s approval default
  to a 1-hour floor (so approvals don't silently deny while you read); this is not
  user-configurable.
- **Pricing degrades silently.** Costs use provider-reported figures when present, else
  the live Helicone table (`tui.pricing.live`, cached 24 h in
  `~/.amplifier/pricing_cache.json`), else the built-in offline table. A fetch failure
  never surfaces an error; rates land for new turns only, so a mid-session swap never
  changes already-recorded costs. Usage the app cannot price at all renders the footer
  and turn-rule `$` figures with a `~` prefix (the total is a floor, never a lie).
- **Silent resilience.** Malformed settings files, an unreadable `keys.env`, and
  unpriceable models are all skipped without errors — run `/doctor` (or
  `amplifier-tui doctor`) when something seems ignored.
