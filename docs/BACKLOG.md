# Backlog

**The backlog lives in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/michaeljabbour/amplifier-app-tui/issues).**
This file indexes them (background, file:line evidence, and acceptance criteria live in each
issue) alongside the shipped ledger and non-goals.

**Campaign status (verified 2026-08-05):** the 2026-07-22 audit backlog (#21–#54) and its
two follow-ups (#90, #91) are closed. The backlog-attractor campaign landed the PRs listed
below; the later hygiene closure is #99, the Forge implementation is #94, live-tail
attachment is #97, and clean lane summaries are #95. The **Status** column cites the
merging PR; GitHub remains the source of truth.

Calibrated 2026-07-22 against `main` (`ac854ef`): the 2026-07 five-specialist audit
(architecture, security, quality, tests, reliability + deterministic lint) was
**re-verified claim-by-claim against the code** before filing — corrections are noted in
the issues (label `audit-2026-07`).

Rubric: every item must stay true to the architecture rules (ADR-0007) — pure renderer
transforms, golden-tested in the same commit, kernel never imports Textual, UI never
touches amplifier-core.

## Supplemental engineering ledger (working tree, 2026-08-05)

This is a compact index to the complete
[supplemental acceptance matrix](audits/feedback-status-2026-08-05.md#supplemental-engineering-work-matrix).
It is separate from the original 23-story **19 PASS · 4 PARTIAL · 0 GAP**
score. The supplemental aggregate is **17 PASS (local evidence) · 4 PARTIAL**;
the partial rows are item 4, item 13, item 20, and item 21. Item 11 is counted
among the 17 local passes while B8 remains PARTIAL overall. Every `PASS` below means
**local working-tree evidence only**; it does not mean committed, pushed,
reviewed, merged, installed, deployed, or released.

| # | Work | Engineering status | Remaining or publication boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/model` | **PASS (local only)** | Providers retain model/capability authority; publish the working-tree routing and rollback changes. |
| 2 | `/effort` | **PASS (local only)** | Validate or disclose provider-specific `none`/`minimal` semantics; publish the local propagation/reporting work. |
| 3 | Manual compaction | **PASS (local only; AC1–AC5)** | Publish the serialized, bounded manual-operation contract, including rich-input preservation and stale-worker fencing; automatic rebuild behavior is item 4. |
| 4 | Repeated automatic compaction | **PARTIAL (upstream); AC1/2/3/5 pass, AC4 open** | `context-simple` still needs cached/incremental request-view maintenance and hysteresis. |
| 5 | Steering/queue recall | **PASS (local only)** | Publish the identity-owned rich-capsule admission/recall behavior. |
| 6 | Exact custom decisions | **PASS (local only)** | Publish the exact-text/exact-decision capture path. |
| 7 | Auto deny/tool-failure continuation | **PASS (local only)** | Publish the deny-and-continue and same-turn failure-recovery behavior. |
| 8 | Settings namespace [#187](https://github.com/michaeljabbour/amplifier-app-tui/issues/187) | **PASS (local only); issue open** | Commit/review/merge the `tui:` whitelist and fallback. `bundle clear` removes/prunes the canonical key when no legacy value exists, but preserves and null-masks legacy `bundle.active` when it does. |
| 9 | Real streaming [#129](https://github.com/michaeljabbour/amplifier-app-tui/issues/129) | **PASS (local Anthropic evidence); issue open** | The currently pinned Anthropic path satisfies the local runtime proof; #129's acceptance list remains unchecked and the result is neither provider-generic nor published. |
| 10 | B7 notification durability | **PASS (local only)** | Publish locked record/ack mutation and terminal-clear priority; live ntfy/mobile smoke remains release evidence. |
| 11 | B8 listener hardening | **PASS (local listener); B8 overall PARTIAL** | Ship a phone-reachable authenticated TLS/tunnel and authorized Teams/Outlook tenant integrations. |
| 12 | Locked source installer | **PASS (local installer); D1 publication PARTIAL** | Review/merge the script, then verify the raw URL from a clean shell. Inventory reproducibility is limited to the same OS/architecture/Python/marker target. |
| 13 | Cold-boot activation [#130](https://github.com/michaeljabbour/amplifier-app-tui/issues/130) | **PARTIAL (upstream)** | Pinned Foundation `dea5bd8` equals inspected upstream `main` and still needs cross-process locking, timeout/retry, signal-aware diagnostics, and lossless state merging; a deterministic probe reproduced overlap and lost state. |
| 14 | Short-ID resume (related broad wrap-up [#148](https://github.com/michaeljabbour/amplifier-app-tui/issues/148)) | **PASS (local sub-contract); issue open** | Publish the shared resolver, deterministic exit codes, completion, and canonical 8-character hints. #148 is a broad open recap, not a short-ID-specific closure issue. |
| 15 | Resume-time orphan-tool repair | **PASS (local, bounded contract)** | Publish recognized stored-shape repair, uncertainty warning, and successful-save-before-mount behavior. Persistence is best-effort on `OSError`, and no all-provider wire-format claim is made. |
| 16 | Interactive routing-matrix choice | **PASS (local only)** | Publish the intuitive number/name picker and literal shortcut help. Until then, users of the old build can enter `s1` or run `amplifier-tui routing use NAME`. |
| 17 | Full-SHA source activation compatibility | **PASS (local installed snapshot); D1 publication PARTIAL** | Publish/reinstall the application dependency containing Foundation's commit-aware clone path. Both reported SHAs are valid and cold-resolve locally; `amplifier-tui update` cannot replace the old application runtime. |
| 18 | Root model → delegate matrix synchronization | **PASS (local only)** | Publish the model/matrix synchronization work. The exact selected model remains the root/orchestrating model; the matching provider-family matrix governs delegated roles. Live resolver switching remains compatibility-scoped to the audited pinned routing runtime. |
| 19 | Live skill activation | **PASS (local only)** | Publish the context-injection path. Successful inline instructions or completed fork results affect the next model turn; missing content/context never reports a false success. |
| 20 | Live bundle and additive module loading | **PARTIAL (safe additive/content path local; singleton identity boundary open)** | Bundle instructions/context and additive providers, tools, hooks, and agent definitions load into the current session; proven live configuration propagates transactionally to child sessions, providers remain idle until selected, and failed remaps restore identity/order. Orchestrator, context-module, existing-provider, and explicit agent-module identity replacement remains a new-session boundary. |
| 21 | Live MCP reconciliation | **PARTIAL (new/owned servers live; boot-owned replacement upstream-bound)** | New and TUI-owned servers connect/reload/remove live. Boot-owned server replacement remains a restart boundary until the upstream aggregate exposes ownership-aware reconciliation. |

## Upstream workstream (tracked, not local gaps)

The four `PARTIAL` rows in the supplemental ledger above are partial only
because their remaining slice lives in an upstream repository, not because
local work is stalled or missing. They are recorded here as upstream
workstream notes so they stop reading as local partials; the ledger rows
themselves stay as-is. Staleness of the pins the TUI tracks against is
watched by the weekly `upstream-drift` workflow, which opens a tracking
issue instead of failing any gate.

- **Row 4 — context-simple compaction (amplifier-core):** the `context-simple`
  module still needs cached/incremental request-view maintenance and
  compaction hysteresis. Local AC1/2/3/5 pass; AC4 stays open until both
  pieces land upstream.
- **Row 13 — cold-boot activation (amplifier-foundation,
  [#130](https://github.com/michaeljabbour/amplifier-app-tui/issues/130)):**
  Foundation `prepare()` still needs cross-process locking, timeout/retry,
  signal-aware diagnostics, and lossless state merging; our deterministic
  probe reproduced cache overlap and lost state against the inspected
  upstream `main`.
- **Row 20 tail — live singleton identity replacement (amplifier-core):**
  replacing orchestrator, context-module, existing-provider, or explicit
  agent-module identity in a running session remains an upstream seam; the
  TUI deliberately mounts only the proven additive path until one exists.
- **Row 21 tail — boot-owned MCP replacement (amplifier-foundation):**
  new and TUI-owned servers already reconcile live; replacing a boot-owned
  server stays a restart boundary until the upstream MCP aggregate exposes
  ownership-aware reconciliation.

## Non-goals

- **Syntax highlighting in answers.** Doable, but fights the restraint aesthetic
  and churns goldens forever; calm teal verbatim reads better in a transcript
  than rainbow soup.
- **Ingested-source deletion** (corpus "Delete original" UI) — not a tui
  feature; no amplifier tool exposes a corpus-document delete.
- **Admin surface** — `source`-authoring, `tool invoke`, `reset`,
  `--install-completion`, `session cleanup`, replay: one-time/admin operations
  that belong in a small separate `amplifier-admin` CLI, not the TUI. (The
  `source` *override* group in #46 is the exception, kept for parity.) The TUI's
  `/module load` is deliberately narrower: additive provider/tool/hook modules
  mount in the current session and propagate to subsequently spawned child
  sessions; existing-provider and orchestrator/context identity changes remain
  a next-session operation.

## Shipped ledger (compact — details in git history and ARCHITECTURE.md)

**Audit round (2026-07-22 → 07-23)** — the full #21–#54 backlog cleared in 34 merged
PRs (#55–#89, #92): security (fail-closed EXEC scan #62, secret-scrub #61, write enforcer
#63, posture inheritance #73), reliability (crash-proof turns #89, hardening pass #77,
no post-rewind ghosts #75), the ui/app.py and transcript.py refactors (#69–#72), CLI/session
parity (onboarding #80, `/config` #83, session-manager #82, `source`/routing #81/#87,
`@mention` #85, notifications #84, telemetry bridge #86), perf (5k transcript budget #79,
no per-token delta persistence #64), and six 2026-07-22 design/decision docs (#55, #56, #57,
#58, #59, #60). The hygiene and Forge residues subsequently closed in #99 and #94;
follow-ups #90 and #91 closed in #97 and #95.

**Amplifier-native / CLI parity** — in-session commands over the live
coordinator; skills (`/skills`, `/skill`); MCP (`tool-mcp` + `/mcp` over
`~/.amplifier/mcp.json`); approvals/modes mounted anchors-identical (off by
default) + posture bridge; routing plumbing; `bundle` CLI over the shared
`BundleRegistry`; `init` (authoritative env-var, `--model`, `--from-env`);
top-level `update` over foundation `check_bundle_status`/`update_bundle`;
team-pulse read tools; needs-you queue (PR #19).

**Codex-inspired core** — `<turn_aborted>` marker + step-boundary steering;
truthful native compaction binding; progressive line-commit streaming with
fence/table holdback; two-axis safety resolution + protected paths; composer
`@file` autocomplete; `/diff` theme-token highlighting; versioned JSONL CLI +
Python/TS subprocess SDKs.

**Pricing** — Decimal estimator parity with app-cli (10/10 parity tests green),
provider-reported cost authoritative, live Helicone pricing wired at startup
(`start_live_pricing`, `kernel/runtime.py`) with 24 h on-disk cache, honest
`~$` marker for unpriced usage, `--resume` cost re-seed.

**Plan/TODO** — real `todo` tool adapter → PlanBlock (demo `plan` shape
coexists); PlanPanel bottom strip, side-by-side with lanes on wide terminals
and stacked below them on narrow terminals so expansion stays interactive.

**Streaming & inline** — committed lines use the final renderer during
streaming; `**bold**`, `` `code` ``, `[text](url)` in `_inline()`; blockquotes
as a `▌` left gutter (style token `blue` — revisit only if the mockup says dim).

**Ambient progress** — delegate summary blocks, real focused-lane transcripts
from diverted child events, lane live tail with ctrl+o cycling (PRs #13, #17).

**Runtime honesty** — thin-wrapper bundle over pinned anchors; hook suppression
(not stripping); `hooks-logging` owns `events.jsonl`, app owns `ui-events.jsonl`;
resume replays under the stored bundle (explicit `--bundle` overrides); event
canary for un-consumed engine event kinds (PRs #19, #20). v0.1.0 tagged.
