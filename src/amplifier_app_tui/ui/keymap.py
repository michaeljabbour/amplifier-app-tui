"""Keymap as data: one table feeding Textual bindings AND footer hints.

Ported pattern from amplifier-app-cli ``ui/key_bindings_table.py`` (itself
after codex ``keymap.rs``): every binding knows its Textual key chord(s),
its on-screen hint label, and the UI contexts it is active in. Because
both the key handlers and the footer read the same table, the keys that
work and the keys the UI advertises can never drift.

Shift+Enter needs the kitty keyboard protocol (Textual >= 8.2.6); on
legacy terminals the ``fallback=True`` alt+enter chord is the working
alternative and :func:`hint_label` swaps the advertised label via
overrides after the terminal probe (DESIGN-SPEC §12).

Esc precedence is specified as a table, not emergent behavior (codex
lesson): :data:`ESC_CHAIN` is the priority order from DESIGN-SPEC §5.

``idle`` used to carry a generic, always-on reminder (history/newline/
rewind/commands) that occupied the footer's right segment on literally
every frame the composer wasn't running or overlaid -- the majority of a
session. That text never changed, so it wasn't a *hint* so much as
permanent teaching copy squatting on status real estate (AC2/AC3: the
footer reserves its space for transient status, attention, and the
actions actually available *right now*). The literal table value here
stays empty -- not replaced with a shorter reminder -- because the same
shortcuts are taught progressively elsewhere: :data:`COMPOSER_PLACEHOLDER`
(shown exactly when there is empty space to teach in) and the ``/keys``
command (:func:`help_rows`, reachable any time via the palette). The
other entries stay: they are genuinely context-sensitive -- tied to a
live overlay or a running turn, not shown "every frame".

Post-merge audit (Finding 1): D4 deliberately dropped the ``ctrl-r
rewind`` fragment along with the rest of that generic reminder, but item
S1 (already DONE before this merge train) has its own AC1 requiring the
footer to expose the rewind shortcut "in plain language when the action
is available" -- which the table's bare "" no longer did, regardless of
whether checkpoints existed. :func:`~amplifier_app_tui.ui.footer.
footer_right_text` reconciles both constraints by composing ``idle``'s
hint live (the same shape ``running`` already uses for its own dynamic
queue-chord swap) instead of a static table lookup: still exactly this
"" the table defines whenever rewind is not genuinely available, but
``ctrl-r rewind`` -- and only that one chord, never the rest of the old
row -- the moment a checkpoint exists (see ``FooterState.
rewind_available`` and ``test_ui_footer.py``). AC2/AC3 hold exactly as
before: nothing rides every frame, only a state-tied, immediately-
available action does.
