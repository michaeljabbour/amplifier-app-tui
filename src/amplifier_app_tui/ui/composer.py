"""The composer: mode badge + prompt glyph + auto-height input
(DESIGN-SPEC §2 item 5, §5).

Single-line feel via a TextArea that grows with content (capped). The
left edge is tinted 2px in the mode accent — chat uses the ``rule``
token (spec §4). The ``[mode]`` badge is clickable (cycles the mode) and
the ``❯`` prompt is green bold.

Input semantics are POSTED AS MESSAGES; the composer never executes
anything itself:

- Enter        → :class:`Composer.Steer` while ``running`` else
                 :class:`Composer.Submit` (the app owns the running flag
                 and sets it on the composer — steer-vs-submit is the
                 app's call, made through that flag).
- Shift+Enter  → :class:`Composer.QueueMessage` (alt+enter is the
                 always-registered legacy-terminal fallback; the
                 ``kitty_protocol`` probe flag only changes which chord
                 is *advertised*).
- Esc          → :class:`Composer.EscPressed` (app resolves via
                 ``keymap.ESC_CHAIN``).
- ``/`` prefix → :class:`Composer.OpenPalette` with the live filter,
                 re-posted on every edit while the text keeps the ``/``
                 prefix; :class:`Composer.PaletteFilterCleared` when the
                 prefix is deleted.
