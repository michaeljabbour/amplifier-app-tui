"""Adoption gate - read-only checker over the `docs/adoption/` stage ledger.

Governance item B5: amplifier-app-tui may only replace amplifier-app-cli after five
staged gates clear. The ledger (`docs/adoption/*.tsv`) is the record; this tool is the
only thing that reads it mechanically, so the negative rules cannot be waved through:

  * a stage cannot be promoted while ANY release-blocking defect is open, no matter how
    much of its usage window has elapsed (AC2);
  * amplifier-app-cli cannot be replaced until stage 5 promotes, which by the same rule
    requires zero unresolved release-blockers (AC5);
  * a placeholder is not a person. `TBD`, `?`, `unknown`, an empty cell and friends are
    refused by name - they can never fill a stage-3 seat, own a stage, or stand in for
    evidence (see `PLACEHOLDERS`);
  * hand-editing `decision = promoted` does not bypass the gate. `check` re-derives every
    promotion condition against every row that claims to be promoted.

Deliberately **read-only**: it never edits a ledger file, and the only external commands
it runs are read-only git plumbing (`rev-parse`, `cat-file -e`) used to prove that a
recorded `tested_commit` is a real commit object in this clone.

Modeled on `pipelines/ledger.py`: stdlib only, TSV rows, never raises (a crash returns a
non-zero exit code and a message, so it is safe to wire into a shell gate).

Commands:
  check                validate every ledger row; exit 0 when clean
  status               one line per stage: owner, decision, window progress, blockers
  promote <stage>      may stage <stage> be promoted? exit 0 = yes, 1 = blocked
                       `promote 5` IS the replacement gate (AC5): stage 4 authorizes the
                       final observation window; stage 5 authorizes deprecation.
  rollback             verify the MECHANICAL half of the documented rollback path:
                       command shapes, the pinned-commit target, and the side-by-side
                       coexistence claim. The walk-through stays human - it says so.

Options:
  --today YYYY-MM-DD   evaluate windows against this date (default: today)
  --dir PATH           ledger directory (default: $ADOPTION_DIR or docs/adoption)
  --no-git             skip git commit resolution (shape checks still apply)
